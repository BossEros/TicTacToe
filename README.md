# TicTacToe Game in Java

This is a simple implementation of the classic TicTacToe game in Java.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. You are X, and the computer is O. Players take turns putting their symbols on the board.
3. The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 symbols in a row, the game ends in a tie.


## How to Run

To run the game, you need to have Java installed on your computer. From the command line, navigate to the directory containing `TicTacToe.java`. Compile the Java file using `javac`:

  `javac TicTacToe.java`

Then, you can run the game with the `java` command:

  `java TicTacToe`

## Features

- Player vs Computer mode: You can play against a computer AI.
- Simple AI: The computer makes its move based on a simple set of rules. It first checks if it can win in the next move, then it checks if it needs to block the player from winning. If neither condition is met, it makes a random move.

## Future Improvements

- Improve the AI to make the game more challenging.
- Add a GUI to make the game more visually appealing.
- Support larger board sizes.
